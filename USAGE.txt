Available builders:
  * plantuml - PlantUML builder that attempts to be feature-complete
  * dot - Graphviz builder that only handles inheritance
  * nomnoml - Nomnoml builder for embedding diagrams in web pages

The --include, --exclude, --has-a, and --is-a
options accept regular expressions.

Note: If both excludes and includes are supplied, types that are in
both lists will be removed from the includes list and then the
includes list will be applied as usual.
